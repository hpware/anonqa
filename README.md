A free and self hostable alternative to `ngl.link`, with no paid subscription, just a simple app that you and your friends can share to manage their QAs (also team support is coming soon!).

## What?

Where I live Taiwan, a lot of ppl use sites like `ngl.link` or `marshmellow` for their anon qa stuff, 2 years ago I tried doing this in linktree (for myself), but failed bacause of it's limited functionalty. Now I have learned some stacks, (the NTP stack (Nuxt, Tailwind, Postgres)), I will try to redo my attempts at doing so, with self hostable services.

## Admin controls
You, the admin that controls the server CAN view users anon messages sent to a member that is on your server, HOWEVER this doesn't give you the person who sent you the data's IP, location, etc... You can delete, modify, and create users in the dashboard, and force remove the current going to be deleted users, forcing it to NOT be recoverable.
