## What?

Where I live Taiwan, a lot of ppl use sites like `ngl.link` or `marshmellow` for their anon qa stuff, 2 years ago I tried doing this in linktree (for myself), but failed bacause of it's limited functionalty. Now I have learned some stacks, (the NTP stack (Nuxt, Tailwind, Postgres)), I will try to redo my attempts at doing so, with self hostable services.
